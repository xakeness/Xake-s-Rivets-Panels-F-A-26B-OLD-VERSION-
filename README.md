Pre formation lights rivets/panels

    This is merely a repository for my old work on the F/A-26B rivets/panels layer, as I have since started working on new rivets/panels that incorporate the new formation lights that are included in the 1.10 version of the game.
    This is a pet project of mine personally, because i've just wanted more details on the 26B
Frequently Asked Questions
When can I get this for all other airframes?

    Check my newer repository "Dirt & Rivets" for the updated version of this and all the other airframes in VTOL VR

Why are there six different versions to download?

    Each version is identical in terms of rivets/panels but I wanted to vary the dirt layer between them so I made six different versions of dirt because it affords more contrast if you have different variations.

Are you going to make more than six?

    I've actually made eight variations of dirt for each of the six airframes in VTOL VR, check my repository or ko-fi page for more info: https://ko-fi.com/xakeness
